SimBot Installation
================================================

SimBot itself requires no compilation of software.  The perl script
comes ready to run with only minor changes to the config.ini file.

You should copy the config.default.ini file to config.ini and customize
the copy.  Keep the file in the same directory where you have the
simbot.pl script installed.  The installation directory is completely
up to you and is mostly irrelevant.

You need the POE::Component::IRC Perl module installed before SimBot
will function correctly.  You may also install these additional
modules for extra features in SimBot:

	Geo::METAR		for weather.pl (Weather Plugin)
	HTML::Entities	for google.pl (Google Search Plugin)
	HTTP::Request	for currency.pl (Currency Plugin)
	LWP				for google.pl, weather.pl, currency.pl
	Net::Dict		for dict.pl (Dictionary Plugin)
	XML::RSS		for rss.pl (RSS Plugin)

This all, of course, requires that you have Perl installed.

All of these modules are available in the CPAN repository, so you
can install them in most Perl installations by running:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell;

This will take you into the Perl module installation tool.  To
install the most recent version of each module, type:

	install POE::Component::IRC LWP Geo::METAR HTML::Entities Net::Dict HTTP::Request XML::RSS

CPAN will do what it needs to install the necessary package and
you'll be on your way.  If you are unsure how to answer the
questions it asks, it is generally safe to accept the defaults,
which are indicated in square brackets after the question, and
can be accepted by pressing Enter.

Once you have installed the script and customized the configuration
to your liking, cd to the proper directory and start the bot using
the command:

	perl ./simbot.pl

Or set the script executable and run it:

	./simbot.pl

================================================
Plugin Installation
================================================

SimBot's plugins are simply perl scripts with special function
calls.  There are a bunch of stock plugins you can use with
SimBot.  If you want to create or install a plugin that isn't
included with SimBot, place it in the "plugins" subdirectory
of SimBot's script directory.

To disable a plugin that is included with SimBot, just change
the plugin's file extension to something other than ".pl" and
it will no longer be loaded.
