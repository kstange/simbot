SimBot Installation
================================================

SimBot is a collection of Perl script.  It does not need to be compiled, but
it does require configuration and the installation of certain dependencies.

Configuration is simple.  Copy the "config.default.ini" file to "config.ini"
and customize the copy.  Many of the options in this file are already at
sane defaults, but you will likely want to customize at least the first
section to identify your bot uniquely.  Keep the file in the same directory
where you have the simbot.pl script installed.  The installation directory
is completely up to you.

It is strongly recommended that you install Perl version 5.8.0 or higher
when using SimBot.  Versions below 5.8.0 will not be officially supported,
but should still work.  Compatibility fixes will be accepted if users
choose to submit them.  If you do not have Perl 5.8.0, please be sure to
install the Encode perl module as well as other dependencies.

You need the POE::Component::IRC Perl module installed before SimBot will
function at all.  You should also install the following modules if you
intend to use any of the stock plugins provided with SimBot:

[ LWP ] (libwww-perl) version 5.802 or higher:

	If you wish to use any stock plugins, you should install LWP.  It
	is a dependency of several other modules and provides the framework
	for accessing web-based content.  v5.802 or later is required to
	handle gzipped content properly in several plugins and utility scripts.

[ Text::Aspell ]

[ DateTime ]

[ POE::Filter::HTTPD ]

All of these modules are available in the CPAN repository, so you can
install them in most Perl environments by running:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell;

This will take you into the Perl module installation tool.  To install the
most recent version of each module, type:

	install <module names>

For example:

	install POE::Component::IRC LWP

CPAN will do what it needs to install the necessary package and you'll be
on your way.  If you are unsure how to answer the questions it asks, it is
generally safe to accept the defaults, which are indicated in square
brackets after the question, and can be accepted by pressing Enter.

Once you have installed the script and customized the configuration to your
liking, cd to the proper directory and start the bot using the command:

	perl ./simbot.pl

Or set the script executable and run it:

	./simbot.pl

================================================
Plugin Installation
================================================

SimBot's plugins are simply perl scripts with special function calls.
There are a bunch of stock plugins you can use with SimBot.  If you want
to create or install a plugin that isn't included with SimBot, place it in
the "plugins" subdirectory of SimBot's script directory.

To disable a plugin that is included with SimBot, just change the plugin's
file extension to something other than ".pl" and it will no longer be
loaded.
