SimBot Installation
================================================

SimBot itself requires no compilation of software.  The perl script comes
ready to run with only minor changes to the config.ini file.

You should copy the config.default.ini file to config.ini and customize the
copy.  Keep the file in the same directory where you have the simbot.pl
script installed.  The installation directory is completely up to you and
is mostly irrelevant.

You need the POE::Component::IRC and Encode Perl modules installed before
SimBot will function correctly.  If you have Perl 5.8.0 or higher installed
you should already have a working Encode.  If you do not, you will need to
install it.  You may also install these additional modules for extra
features in SimBot:

	LWP								for google.pl, weather.pl, currency.pl
	POE::Component::Client::HTTP	for rss.pl (RSS Plugin)
	XML::RSS						for rss.pl (RSS Plugin)
	Net::Dict						for dict.pl (Dictionary Plugin)
	HTML::Entities					for google.pl (Google Search Plugin)
	Geo::METAR						for weather.pl (Weather Plugin)
	DBI::SQLite                  for sqlite-logger.pl (logging plugin)

This all, of course, requires that you have Perl installed.

All of these modules are available in the CPAN repository, so you can
install them in most Perl installations by running:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell;

This will take you into the Perl module installation tool.  To install the
most recent version of each module, type:

	install <module names>

For example:

	install POE::Component::IRC Encode Geo::METAR LWP

CPAN will do what it needs to install the necessary package and you'll be
on your way.  If you are unsure how to answer the questions it asks, it is
generally safe to accept the defaults, which are indicated in square
brackets after the question, and can be accepted by pressing Enter.

If you want to use the SQLite logging plugin, you will need to create
its database file. Just run:

    perl ./sqlite-logger-setup.pl
    
This only needs to be done once.

Once you have installed the script and customized the configuration to your
liking, cd to the proper directory and start the bot using the command:

	perl ./simbot.pl

Or set the script executable and run it:

	./simbot.pl

================================================
Plugin Installation
================================================

SimBot's plugins are simply perl scripts with special function calls.
There are a bunch of stock plugins you can use with SimBot.  If you want
to create or install a plugin that isn't included with SimBot, place it in
the "plugins" subdirectory of SimBot's script directory.

To disable a plugin that is included with SimBot, just change the plugin's
file extension to something other than ".pl" and it will no longer be
loaded.
