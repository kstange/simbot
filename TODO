================================================
SimBot ToDo List
================================================

Targets for 6.0 Beta
======================

- Implement automatic database backups.
- Implement learning ignore by hostmask/nickname.
- Implement autokick plugin.

Targets for 6.0 Final
======================

- Test dalnet and chanserv style services plugins.
- Polish the documentation (what documentation?).
- Standardize and clean up the debug output.
- Crush evil bugs!

Targets for 7.0 Final
======================

- Redefine Plugin API using POE or related Perl 6 functionality.
- Allow the user to specify a custom data directory.

General Targets
======================
- Use POE better, blocking less and using more events.
- Eventually recognize the possibility for joining 2+ channels.
- Allow for media other than IRC (connection plugins) (maybe).
- Implement authentication for bot administration.
- Reduce memory footprint.
- Improve data storage format.
- Implement a logger plugin.
- RSS plugin desperately needs too handle all links/guids changing
- Plugin loader needs to be rewritten completely.
- Make sentence generation bonus __BEGIN/__END as sentence gets longer to reduce the chance of (but not obliterate) excessively long sentences.

Wish List
======================
- MySQL logger plugin. Could retrieve logs between certain times on demand. Allow for seen to filter out certain events on demand. Statistics.
