================================================
SimBot ToDo List
================================================

Targets for 1.0 Beta
======================

- Implement automatic database backups.
- Implement learning ignore by hostmask/nickname.
- Implement autokick plugin.
- Make interesting word base score adaptive by db size, because over time a constant is not enough, and lots of words become uninteresting.
- Improve data storage format by converting to DBD-SQLite.
- Convert all private messaging to private notices, to comply better with RFC 2812 section 3.3.2.
- Verify backwards compatibility with LWP < 5.802.  We should never offer to accept gzipped content if we can't decode it.

Targets for 1.0 Final
======================

- Test dalnet and chanserv style services plugins.  Preferrably, merge these two services plugins, unless it's absolutely impossible.
- Polish (as in make better, not Poland) the documentation.
- Standardize and clean up the debug output.
- Test the hell out of every feature.

Targets for Beyond 1.0
======================
- RSS plugin should handle all links/guids changing somehow that doesn't involve printing the entire feed to the channel.
- Make sentence generation give a bonus to __BEGIN/__END tags as the sentence gets longer in order to reduce the chance of excessively long sentences.
- Rework the Plugin API using POE or related Perl 6 functionality.
- Eliminate all unnecessary synchronous operations that might slow normal operations.
- Allow the user to specify a custom data directory.

Wish List
======================
- Integrated web server using POE::Component::Server::HTTP.
- Implement authentication for bot administration.
- Eventually recognize the possibility of joining 2 or more channels.
- Allow for media other than IRC (connection plugins).
- Eventually port to the OOB functionality in Perl 6.
