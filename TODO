================================================
SimBot ToDo List
================================================

Targets for 1.0 Beta
======================

- Implement automatic database backups.
- Implement learning ignore by hostmask/nickname.
- Implement autokick plugin.

Targets for 1.0 Final
======================

- Test dalnet and chanserv style services plugins.
- Polish the documentation (what documentation?).
- Standardize and clean up the debug output.
- Crush evil bugs!

Targets for Beyond 1.0
======================
- Use POE better, blocking less and using more events.
- Reduce memory footprint.
- Improve data storage format. Look into converting databases to DBD-SQLite.
- RSS plugin desperately needs to handle all links/guids changing.
- Currency plugin needs to be thrown out.
- Weather plugin needs to stop using Geo::METAR.
- Make sentence generation bonus __BEGIN/__END as sentence gets longer to reduce the chance of (but not obliterate) excessively long sentences.
- Redefine Plugin API using POE or related Perl 6 functionality.
- Allow the user to specify a custom data directory.

Wish List
======================
- Integrated web server using POE::Component::Server::HTTP.
- Implement authentication for bot administration.
- Eventually recognize the possibility of joining 2 or more channels.
- Allow for media other than IRC (connection plugins).
