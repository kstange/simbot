# SimBot

SimBot is Perl IRC bot implemented via the Perl Object Environment and POE::Component::IRC. It is primarily intended as an entertainment bot and does not do any form of channel management.

All the people who played with and contributed to this bot have moved on to other things, so this is just here to preserve for posterity.  The bot does run at last check, but some features refer external resources that no longer exist or have substantially changed, and it predates many common changes in IRC server behavior, so it would likely require some work to be made fully operational.
