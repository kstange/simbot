# SimBot

SimBot is Perl IRC bot implemented via the Perl Object Environment and POE::Component::IRC. It is primarily intended as an entertainment bot and does not presently do any form of channel management. It is likely that some channel management features will become available in the future via plugins.

I don't really use IRC anymore and all the people who played with and contributed to this bot have moved on to other things, so this is just preserved for posterity here.
