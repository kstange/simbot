Version 1.0 alpha: (03 May 2005)
	* plugins/seen.pl:
	  - Removed, replaced with sqlite-logger.pl's seen support
	* plugins/sqlite-logger.pl
	  - Now supports %seen. %log seen will hang around for the time being.
	  - %seen <nick> <events> count <number> will give multiple matches, up
	    to <number>.
	  - %seen <nick> <events> content <words> will look in the log for the
	    phrase <words>.
	* simbot.pl:
	  - Now properly stops sending data to the server when trying to quit.
	

Version 1.0 alpha: (01 May 2005)
	* plugins/currency.pl:
	  - Rewritten! Now uses SOAP::Lite to fetch exchange information instead
	    of stealing it from xe.com.

Version 1.0 alpha: (30 Apr 2005)
	* plugins/aspell.pl:
	  - New plugin! Checks and offers suggestions for the user's spelling.
	    Requires Text::Aspell.

Version 1.0 alpha: (31 Dec 2004)
	* Happy New Year!
	* plugins/sqlite-logger.pl:
	  - Added a %log last <event> command, which will tell you when
	    something last happened. Useful for figuring out what the topic
	    used to be when someone changes it. Or will be once
	    'before that' works.

Version 1.0 alpha: (17 Dec 2004)
	* plugins/dict.pl:
	  - Added a feature that lists the dictionaries containing a specific
	    word.  Syntax is %define dictionaries with [word].

Version 1.0 alpha: (05 Dec 2004)
	* plugins/weather.pl:
	  - Uses NOAA's new XML current observations instead of the rather
	    brittle METAR for stations in the US. Other stations will still
	    use METAR.
	* plugins/sqlite-logger.pl:
	  - Creates the tables if they don't exist automatically.

Version 1.0 alpha: (04 Dec 2004)
	* plugins/sqlite-logger.pl:
	  - New plugin! Logs all chat to a SQLite database. Supports
	    %log recap and %log seen commands. Recap is intelligent, only
	    recaps what you actually missed. Seen supports the special
	    phrase 'before that' to look for the previous match. You can
	    also provide one or more of say, action, join, part, quit, kick,
	    mode, topic after the nickname to look up to limit to those
	    events. recap and seen should eventually replace the %recap and
	    %seen plugins.

Version 1.0 alpha: (28 Nov 2004)
	* plugins/tinyurl.pl:
	  - New plugin! Looks for TinyURLs in chat, and announces where
	    they point. No more stealth afilliate links!

Version 1.0 alpha: (02 Nov 2004)
	* plugins/rss.pl:
	  - We now trap XML parse errors so that we don't crash if the parsing
	    of a feed fails completely.

Version 1.0 alpha: (20 Oct 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	  - Added the ability to connect on non-standard ports.
	* plugins/rss.pl:
	  - Added complaining and bailing if the RSS feed cannot be written
	    to disk.

Version 1.0 alpha: (05 Sep 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	  - Added command line options --debug and --config to override the
	    default configuration file and debug level for the session.
	  - Added ANSI colors to output messages.

Version 1.0 alpha: (31 Jul 2004)
	* plugins/dice.pl:
	  - Added a %rps command, which makes the bot play the Rock, Paper,
	    Scissors games.

Version 1.0 alpha: (26 Jul 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	  - Added send_pieces_with_notice to allow large blocks of text to be
	    broken up and sent by notice instead of normal messages.
	* plugins/recap.pl:
	  - If a user leaves and rejoins the channel, recap will attempt to
	    give them all the lines since departing by default until the
	    backlog is exceeded, at which point the default returns to 10.
	* plugins/rss.pl:
	  - Added natural language data for getting RSS feeds. (Vincent Gevers)
	  - Added expire option, which determines how often the plugin wants to
	    fetch RSS updates.  Unset, it defaults to 1 hour. (Vincent Gevers)
	* plugins/nlp.pl:
	  - Added an event, event_plugin_nlp_call to allow plugins to specify
	    which function to call, instead of hardcoding it to try nlp_match
	    in the plugin's namespace.

Version 1.0 alpha: (25 Jul 2004)
	* plugins/services.dalnet.pl:
	  - New services plugin designed to function with DALnet's chanserv.
	    (Vincent Gevers)
	* plugins/services.chanserv.pl:
	  - New services plugin designed to work with a more generic
	    chanserv-based IRC network.  (Vincent Gevers)

Version 1.0 alpha: (21 Jul 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	  - Added numberize function which converts written out numbers like
	    "two thousand" into digits, like 2000.
	  - The %help command works again, instead of calling the %stats
	    function.
	* plugins/nlp.pl:
	  - We now use the new numberize function, so that natural language
	    parsing can understand numbers more completely.

Version 1.0 alpha: (14 Jul 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	  - query_userhost_mask can now be used by plugins to watch for
	    important user@host configurations and modify them instead of
	    normal processing.

Version 1.0 alpha: (13 Jul 2004)
	* plugins/dict.pl:
	  - %define_private command is gone, replaced with a parameter to the
	    normal command.
	  - Relatively short definitions can now be forced to display in the
	    channel with "%define word publicly", but long definitions will
	    still insist upon appearing privately.

Version 1.0 alpha: (11 Jul 2004)
	* plugins/rss.pl:
	  - The RSS plugin no longer downloads feeds that aren't being
	    announced every hour/on load, instead it downloads them as
	    needed.

Version 1.0 alpha: (10 Jul 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - SimBot now caches hostmasks for users when they enter the channel
	     and uncaches them when they leave.
	   - The hostmask utility function should now work for nicknames, as
	     well as actual hostmasks.
	* plugins/rss.pl:
	   - Settings are now in config.ini instead of hard coded in the
	     script. Finally.
	* plugins/info.pl:
	   - We now honor snooze, the info plugin shouldn't learn or respond
	     when SimBot is snoozing unless addressed.
	* plugins/services.undernet.pl:
	   - Bans are now passed to Channel Service.

Version 1.0 alpha: (09 Jul 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Added a means to override standard IRC commands like kick, op,
	     and voice with alternate functions.  This means that calling
	     SimBot::send_kick can be made to ask your network's ChanServ to
	     do it through a plugin.
	* plugins/services.undernet.pl:
	   - Added support for the kick command, but some error checking will
	     need to be added along with overrides for other IRC functions.

Version 1.0 alpha: (04 Jul 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Added snooze mode which can be toggled by users in the channel.
	     If a conversation is bizarre or private and users want to prevent
	     the bot from learning what is said and responding conversationally
	     this mode will prevent both temporarily.  It resets to off when
	     the bot starts up, and the command %snooze [off|on] toggles it.
	     $SimBot::snooze is available as a boolean to any plugins that want
	     to check whether snooze is on before generating an action.

Version 1.0 alpha: (26 Apr 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Added a new event handler that allows plugins to identify when
	     the bot is addressed and do something else.  Returning false
	     lets the plugin stop the normal output addressing creates.
	   - Plugins can now define hashes, which effectively allows them to
	     pass back arbitrary objects and associate them with a hash entry
	     for their specific plugin id.  Some other plugin (or the core)
	     could then use such hash tables to get information from a plugin.
	   - We try to ignore bits of leading text that appear to come from
	     logs now.  This should reduce the amount of junk that gets added
	     to the database.
	* plugins/nlp.pl:
	   - New plugin allows "addressing text" sent to the channel to be
	     caught by the plugin and parsed for natural language commands.
	     Plugins (so far weather, dice, and seen... which turn out to all
	     be plugins I did not write) can now add to hashes that define
	     what type of language represents a request they can understand.

Version 1.0 alpha: (23 Apr 2004)
	* plugins/info.pl:
	   - If you address the bot while teaching, it will correctly take
	     the entire line after the 'is' as the factoid, instead of cutting
	     at punctuation.

Version 1.0 alpha: (02 Mar 2004)
	* plugins/dict.pl:
	   - Changed the dictionary plugin to try to find a definition for
	     the requested word in any available dictionary unless otherwise
	     specified.  The command language now uses the key "in" to separate
	     the term from the dictionary.  If you want to look up a term
	     that contains the word "in", you can quote the term with double
	     quotes.

Version 1.0 alpha: (01 Mar 2004)
	* plugins/recap.pl:
	   - Added all the remaining events to recap: channel modes, quit,
	     join, part, and nick changes.
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Added an event for nick changes, since we needed it for recap.
	   - Added a "lost word" check on startup.  This takes a little extra
	     time, but it ensures that all words that aren't really usable
	     are completely gone from the database.

Version 1.0 alpha: (28 Feb 2004)
	* plugins/rss.pl:
	   - Announce preselected RSS feeds in the IRC channel.  This is
	     nifty if your channel is slow.  We announce a number of feeds by
	     default, including slashdot, and developer personal feeds, which
	     are probably boring.

Version 1.0 alpha: (27 Feb 2004)
	* *.pl:
	   - All files now use perl's strict mode, which should mean our code
	     is absolutely perfect. :P
	* simbot.pl:
	   - We now support the %delete command which will remove any item from
	     the database provided it has been seen fewer than the max number
	     as specified in the config file.
	* config.default.ini:
	   - We now use a plain text file (not a script file) for configuration
	     this is safer because no one can break the bot by putting bad
	     code in the config file.
	* plugins/error.pl:
	   - the %list command is now in the error plugin instead of directly
	     inside the main script.

Version 1.0 alpha: (26 Feb 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Added a new configuration option that allows you to change the
	     prefix that the bot will use to recognize commands.  The default
	     will remain as %.
	* plugins/dice.pl:
	   - It is now possible to flip more than 1 coin at a time.

Version 1.0 alpha: (25 Feb 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Plugins now register their callbacks with references to functions
	     instead of a string representing the functions name.  This keeps
	     us from having to care about what package the plugin is in, so
	     long as it's got a function we can talk to, and we no longer
	     need to define separate packages for separate commands in a
	     single plugin.

Version 1.0 alpha: (23 Feb 2004)
	* plugins/info.pl:
	   - Infobot style sentence learning. Tries to learn x (is/are) y
	     from chat it sees or explicit setting with %info.
	     Factoid retrieval is only through %info currently.

Version 1.0 alpha: (20 Feb 2004)
	* plugins/dict.pl:
	   - New plugin allows users to request definitions using the DICT
	     protocol from several different databases.  At the moment, we
	     are defaulting to use Jargon, but this could change.

version 1.0 alpha: (19 Feb 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Introduced send_message, send_action, and send_notice to replace
	     calling the POE::Kernel directly whenever we send a message.
	     This means we now get a chance to log things that the bot is
	     going to say.
	   - Added events event_*_out that are fired for plugins wanting to
	     know when the bot has sent a message out.
	* plugins/*.pl:
	   - All plugins now use send_message, send_action, and send_notice
	     for all their sending needs.
	* plugins/recap.pl:
	   - This plugin can now see what the bot says and logs it correctly.
	   - Fixed a bunch of message ordering logic to make sure we log in
	     the same order as time passes.
	* plugins/weather.pl:
	   - We don't fail the weather plugin if we're unable to load the
	     station name cache.  Station names will then be cached for
	     the current session only and lost upon quitting.

version 1.0 alpha: (13 Feb 2004)
	* Today is Friday the 13th.  I am told the ChangeLog must have an
	  entry for today.  However, sadly, I didn't do anything, so this
	  is all you get.

Version 1.0 alpha: (12 Feb 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - We now exit the POE event loop in a way that lets us quit IRC
	     without doing the famous "EOF from client."
	   - New configuration option to make bot prompt for a quit message
	     on an interrupt signal, and to set a default quit message if
	     prompting is off.
	* plugins/recap.pl:
	   - New plugin which recounts up to X lines of chat on demand. It's
	     great for catching up on a conversation after joining.  The
	     plugin is currently incomplete, but it is usable.
	* plugins/currency.pl:
	   - New plugin which does currency conversions when passed an amount
	     and two currency abbreviations.

Version 1.0 alpha: (11 Feb 2004)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Context is now detected and a sentence is generated from the
	     middle outward to (possibly) end up on-topic. An interesting
	     word is chosen from the original message based on a scoring
	     system that can be extended through query_word_score callback.
	   - New method for storing the database in memory (desperately
	     needed to eliminate very slow scoring of interesting words).
	     This new method also speeds up sentence generation a great
	     deal, though it will use a bit more memory.
	* plugins/seen.pl:
	   - We now see topic changes and channel notices.

Version 1.0 alpha: (22 Dec 2003)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - A lot of code has been cleaned up and many core functions were
	     renamed for consistency.  A lot more debug information has been
	     added to verbosity level 4.
	   - Added: all planned events are now implemented and comments
	     document the parameters they should each deliver to callbacks.
	   - Added: a model now exists for services plugins.  Undernet is
	     the default and only plugin currently.  Only one services
	     plugin may load and its package name will be:
	       SimBot::plugin::services::pluginid
	     The plugin to load will be specified in the config.pl file.
	     If none is specified, the bot will not use any services features.
	     Anyone that wishes to implement a services plugin for ChanServ
	     would be welcome to do so.
	   - Added: plugins may now add items to lists, with a new case that
	     allows them to push nicknames onto an "ISON" list to poll for
	     whether a nickname is currently on IRC.
	* config.default.pl:
	   - Added: new configuration options for logging into services.
	     None of these values are required, and plugins can choose to
	     look for different ones.  ChanServ, for example, would not
	     tend to look for a user because it's going to work with
	     NickServ.  The previous username setting is now used only
	     for the user portion of the bot's hostmask and the password
	     setting is gone.
	* plugins/services.undernet.pl:
	   - Added: new plugin splits out services login for undernet into
	     a plugin.
	   - Added: detection for X being offline and returning so that the
	     bot can automatically log in, recover voice and request an
	     invitation.

Version 1.0 alpha: (21 Dec 2003)
	* plugins/weather.pl:
	   - Added: metar command allows user request a raw METAR report
	     if they are so inclined.

Version 1.0 alpha: (17 Dec 2003)
	* simbot.pl:
	   - Added: send_pieces() method that will automatically break up
	     given text into pieces that fit into the standard IRC message
	     length and send them on to their destination.
	   - Fixed: the plugin loader will not display any compile time
	     errors that prevent a plugin from loading successfully.
	* plugins/google.pl:
	   - Fixed: Google define: results so that they will appear in cases
	     where the result is too long for one IRC message and added a
	     requirement for HTML::Entities so we can convert the define
	     string into plain text.

Version 1.0 alpha: (15 Dec 2003)
	* plugins/weather.pl:
	   - Added support for fetching station names, if available.
	   - We also now work around the fact that Geo::METAR is unable to
	     see a temperature report when there's no dewpoint.
	   - We deal with the possible case that there's no temperature in the
	     report in a way that makes some amount of grammatical sense.
	   - We also deal with variable winds (if there's no english name and
	     there is a windspeed, it's got to be variable).
	   - We deal slight chance that the METAR report is coming up as NIL,
	     because Geo:METAR assumes that to be a windspeed.

Version 1.0 alpha: (14 Dec 2003)
	* plugins/google.pl: google plugin now supports define: queries

Version 1.0 alpha: (12 Dec 2003)
	* added: plugins are now out on their own with a partial implementation
	  of a plugin architecture.  The idea is that your plugin declares
	  itself a package and then you plugin_register() and connect your
	  callback functions to different events.
	* added: a %error plugin now spits out random error messages on demand
	* added: the core is now defined as a package called SimBot.

Version 1.0 alpha: (06 Dec 2003)
	* added: %flip
	* fixed: seen now sees kicks

Version 1.0 alpha: (05 Dec 2003)
	* added: seen support! Well, somewhat. %seen SomeLoser
	* added: dice!
	* added: debug output for notices from channel service

Version 1.0 alpha: (04 Dec 2003)
	* added: support for %weather via Geo::METAR
	* added: google search via %find now turns itself off without LWP
	* added: you can now add "plugins" inside simbot.pl, a feature which
	  will be split out later
	* added: extended number of verbose levels to 4 for crazy output
	* fixed: cleaned out most of the warnings generated with perl -w
	* fixed: failure to save the rules file is no longer a success
	* fixed: if the rules can't load, do not later try to save them
	* fixed: smileys with = at the end of a line should not be recorded
	* removed: some sleep calls that aren't used for anything
	* removed: %version command to eliminate duplicate ChangeLog

Version 0.99.16: (03 Dec 2003)
	* added: config.pl splits the configuration from the main script
	* added: ChangeLog splits the ChangeLog from the main script
	* added: some error checking should die on a bad configuration
	* removed: evil hacky privmsg functions that could be abused
	* this will be the first version to appear in SF.net CVS

Version 0.99.15: (17 Nov 2003)
	* fixed: %find's queries sometimes broke the calculator result
	* added: %find can now use the Google calculator!
	* added: bot should see = as eyes where appropriate
	* added: bot will accept its name in the middle of a line
	* added: added todo list function (%todo)
	* added: expanded the set of ignored keywords
	* added: ignore lines that have no alphanumeric characters
	* added: strip out all formatting codes before processing text
	* added: allow ASCII international characters to be recorded

Version 0.99.14:
	* fixed: bot should no longer try to record blank actions
	* fixed: bot will not report dead word count without dead words
	* added: expanded the set of ignored keywords
	* added: bot will track punctuation by first word, not last word

Version 0.99.13:
	* fixed: a problem with infinite loops in sentence generation
	* fixed: redesigned the sentence generator to be much faster
	* fixed: bot will no longer record lines that reduce as empty
	* fixed: improved smiley detection to reduce errors

Version 0.99.12:
	* fixed: added disconnect check & 15 second wait between attempts
	* fixed: eliminated bot babble in messages by using notice reply
	* added: bot will now attempt to autorecover the default nickname

Version 0.99.11:
	* fixed: cleaned up some connection related issues where possible
	* added: a new quip for %list

Version 0.99.10:
	* added: new filter items to the word filter using regex
	* added: responds to current nick, even if it's not nick or alttag
	* added: respond to addressing tag plain or  with !, ? and smileys
	* added: records equals signs with text

Version 0.99.9:
	* added: automatic rejoin on kick from channel
	* added: %find searches Google with "I'm Feeling Lucky"
	* removed: autokick on @find was not necessary and kinda boring
	* cleaned up the script, fixed warnings and added comments
	* notify the user that % is the proper command prefix on use of ! or \@
	* on use of %list, print out a silly message; suggestions welcome
	* fixed: automatic nick collision workaround should work now
	* fixed: crazy color coding should not break bot commands

Version 0.99.8:
	* converted from the horribly ill-maintained Net::IRC module
	  to POE::Component::IRC, which is more robust and confusing
	* fixed: no longer crashes when my network changes slightly
	* fixme: known issue: bot will not quit gracefully.. investigating

Version 0.99.7:
	* fixed: "0" not considered a word on the rhs, counting as NULL
	* fixed: trailing smiley caused a counting error
	* fixed: logic error in punctuation detection
	* fixed: rare debug message had a bad variable reference
	* added: %help, %version commands

Version 0.99.6 and earlier:
        * add a stats function -DONE
	* fixme: __BEGIN should never appear. -FIXED
	* fixme: if no sentence to occur after a /me, repeats previous
	  sentences -FIXED
	* accept .'s inside words -FIXED

Version 0.99.1:
	* first version of SimBot written in Perl.  This will make processing
	  text much, much cooler.
